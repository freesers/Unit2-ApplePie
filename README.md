# Apple Pie

A simple word-guessing game. Start by selecting your difficulty level and press "Play!" After the last word you will be redirected to the start page

# EXTRA
* Start screen where the user selects the difficulty with a slider, before the game is started
* With Pixelmator, i've added more apples (tries, max 13) to the tree if the user selects easier difficulty
* After playing, the user is redirect to the startscreen ("Welcome to Aple Pie (again)")
